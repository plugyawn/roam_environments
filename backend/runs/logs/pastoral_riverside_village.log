The architecture features local materials and traditional construction methods appropriate for the setting, with buildings ranging from 1-3 stories as you'd expect in such communities.\n\nThis design accommodates a population estimate of 500-2000 residents and includes all essential infrastructure elements while preserving the authentic pastoral character you requested.", "type": "TextMessage"}}

Here's what I've created for you:\n\nThe village is laid out on a 100m x 100m plot with a traditional European pastoral style. At the heart of the community sits a 20m x 20m cobblestone market square featuring a central fountain and vendor stalls surrounded by authentic period buildings.\n\nKey design elements include:\n- A flowing river along the southern edge with natural banks and docking facilities for trade and fishing\n- A stone bridge (15m long) connecting the village to the opposite riverbank\n- Residential areas to the north and east with a mix of timber-frame buildings with thatched roofs and stone constructions with slate roofs\n- A beautiful stone church with bell tower positioned on the western side\n- A traditional well with wooden frame near the market square\n- Curved cobblestone roads connecting all village elements\n\nThe layout follows historical patterns of European riverside market towns, with the market square logically placed for easy river access while maintaining the intimate, walkable scale typical of pastoral villages. The architecture features local materials and traditional construction methods appropriate for the setting, with buildings ranging from 1-3 stories as you'd expect in such communities.\n\nThis design accommodates a population estimate of 500-2000 residents and includes all essential infrastructure elements while preserving the authentic pastoral character you requested.", "type": "TextMessage"}], "stop_reason": "The scene design for a pastoral riverside village with a market square has been completed, including a detailed map plan, asset specifications, and scene graph with validated placements."}}
